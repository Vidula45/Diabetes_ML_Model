# Diabetes_ML_Model

## Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is an increasingly prevalent chronic disease characterized by the bodyâ€™s inability to metabolize glucose. Finding the disease at the early stage helps reduce medical costs and the risk of patients having more complicated health problems. we used the Logistic Regression and other machine learning techniques to build a model to predict the probability that a patient develops DM based on their personal information and recent laboratory results.

Tools used: Jupyter Notebook , Python 3.7

Models : Logistic Regression , Decision Tree and Random Forest.

### Conclusion: Random Forest has higher accuracy and can be treated as a good model.
